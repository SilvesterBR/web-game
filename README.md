# Brief
A repository developed from `2023` to `Present Day` from a collection of projects I have developed and published in my spare time.

# Web-Game
This project was an assignment for a web development course and was the first interaction I had with HTML and CSS, this assignment greatly aided me in understanding such languages. We were tasked to create a scalable grid which could be filled with Asteroids, Robots, Mines and a single Player. The players goal was to create a map and active all the mines in the map and destroy the robots. Whilst this is happening, the robots goal to pathfind and touch the player, causing a game over.
